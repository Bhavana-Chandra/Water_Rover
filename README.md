# Water_Rover
Our water rovers address ocean plastic waste by collecting debris from water surfaces. Equipped with cameras and controlled via a mobile app, they use Raspberry Pi for intelligent operation. Lightweight, durable, and driven by servo motors, they navigate efficiently, promoting environmental conservation.
